# Privacy-Preserving-Assocition-Rule-Mining-Algorithm

Recently privacy-preserving assocition rules mining algorithm have been proposed to support data privacy , However , the algorithms have an additional overhead to insert fake items and cannot hide data frequency . In this project we used privacy preserving assocition rule mining algorithm or encrypted data in cloud computing . for assocition rule minig rule we utilize apriori Algorithm by using Elgamal Cryptosystem without additional fake transaction.

## Introduction

The current trend in the application space towards systems
of loosely coupled and dynamically bound components
that enables just-in-time integration jeopardizes the security
of information that is shared between the broker, the
requester, and the provider at runtime. In particular, new
advances in data mining and knowledge discovery, that allow
for the extraction of hidden knowledge in enormous
amount of data, impose new threats on the seamless integration
of information. In this paper, we consider the problem
of building privacy preserving algorithms for one category
of data mining techniques, the association rule mining. We
introduce new metrics in order to demonstrate how security
issues can be taken into consideration in the general framework
of association rule mining, and we show that the complexity
of the new heuristics is similar to this of the original
algorithms.
